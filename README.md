# Spam_Ham_Detector_using_NLP
In practically every industry today, from business to education, emails are used. HAM and SPAM are the two subcategories of emails. Email spam, often known as junk email or unwelcome email, is a kind of email that can be used to hurt any user by sapping their time and computing resources and stealing important data. Spam email volume is rising quickly day by day. Today's email and IoT service providers face huge and massive challenges with spam identification and filtration. Email filtering is one of the most important and well-known methods among all the methods created for identifying and preventing spam.

In this project we are going to using multiple NLP methods like:
Tokenization /n
Stemming /n
Lemmatization /n
Bag-of-words representation /n
TF-IDF /n

And, finaly using Naive Bayes classifier to classify weather a e-mail is SPAM or a HAM.
